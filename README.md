## 🌍 Project Overview

This project investigates the current state of **alternative energy adoption** globally compared to Bangladesh’s approach. It leverages:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **topic modeling** on 60,000 tweets.
- Country-level energy infrastructure analysis.
- Data from public sources like the **Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission**.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Scraped tweets related to *Solar* and *Lithium* energy using Python + Google Colab.
- Cleaned and preprocessed tweets.
- Used **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** + **pyLDAvis** to identify dominant discussion topics.
- Performed **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for visualization.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Global Focus**: Countries like India and companies like Tesla are driving the alternative energy conversation.
- **Bangladesh**: Is still in early stages, with only ~1% of its national grid sourced from renewables.
- **Barriers**: Infrastructure, policy, and technological access.
